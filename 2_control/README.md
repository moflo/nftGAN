Using StyleGAN with NFT datasets

## Control

WIP

Working to using styleGAN mixing methodology to have specific generative control over nftGAN features, initially using styleGAN trained on FFHQ/CelebA datasets together with the Chain Runners NFT dataset. Eventually, using the NFT "traits" as generative input.
